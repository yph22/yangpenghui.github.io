## 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Penghui Yang (杨鹏辉)**, a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Building Environment and Energy Engineering** at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I will begin my **Ph.D. journey** in **2026** at the [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (Shanghai AI Lab)](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), under the supervision of [Yuhang Zang](https://yuhangzang.github.io/), in a **joint training program** with the [School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SAI)](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/).  

My research interests broadly lie in:

- **Deep Learning**  
- **Multimodal Learning**  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  

Currently, I’m particularly interested in **vision-language pre-training** and **post-training alignment** of large multimodal models.

📄 For more details, please see my [**CV**](/assets/CV.pdf)

## 💡 Research Interests

I am broadly interested in **foundation models** and **multimodal intelligence**, especially topics at the intersection of **representation learning**, **model efficiency**, and **alignment**.  
My long-term goal is to build **trustworthy and efficient general-purpose AI systems** that can adapt across modalities and domains.

## 🌱 Outside of Research

When I’m not coding or writing, I enjoy:  
- 🏃 **Fitness, basketball, and billiards** — keeping balance between body and mind.  
- ☕ **Café hopping** — good ideas often come with good coffee.
