I am now a senior undergraduate student majoring in Building Environment and Energy Engineering (under the category of [Energy and Electrical Engineering](https://join-tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1061/1276.htm)) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I will embark on my doctoral journey at [Shanghai ailab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/)(very fortunate to be advised by [Zang Yuhang](https://yuhangzang.github.io/) in 2026 (in a joint training program with [SAI](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/)). My research interest includes Large Language Models, Multimodal Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

You can find my CV here: [Yang Penghui's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
